### Prerequisites 📋

You'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [NPM](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer.

```
node@v10.16.0 or higher
npm@6.9.0 or higher
git@2.17.1 or higher
```

Also, you can use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) instead of NPM ☝️

```
yarn@v1.21.1 or higher
```

## How To Use 🔧

From your command line, first clone Simplefolio:

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/jordon-ogo/Portfolio

# Go into the repository
$ cd simplefolio

# Remove current origin repository
$ git remote remove origin
```

Then you can install the dependencies either using NPM or Yarn:

Using NPM:
```bash
# Install dependencies
$ npm install

# Start development server
$ npm start
```
Using Yarn:
```bash
# Install dependencies
$ yarn

# Start development server
$ yarn start
```

**NOTE**:
If your run into issues installing the dependencies with NPM, use this command:

```bash
# Install dependencies with all permissions
$ sudo npm install --unsafe-perm=true --allow-root
```

Once your server has started, go to this url `http://localhost:8080/` and you will see the website running on a Development Server:
